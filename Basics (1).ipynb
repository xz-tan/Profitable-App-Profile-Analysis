The company only build apps that are free to download and install, thus the main source of revenue is the in-app ads. This also means that the revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use the apps.\n",

    "## Goal of the project\n",
    "---\n",
    "The goal of this project is to analyze data to help the developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users, and hence they can focus on developing these certain type of apps to maximise revenue for the company.\n",

    "Unfortunately, as of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million apps on Google Play and App Store respectively and collecting data for over 4 million apps require significant amount of time and money, so we will try to analyze a sample of the data instead. Luckily, there are two existing data sets online that are suitable for our goals."

The general idea is that the Google Play has a wider variety of apps and and has an equal share of practical and entertainment apps. However, further research into the \"Family\" apps will show that it mainly comprise of games for children. Thus, nearly 29% of apps in the Google Play can be considered **Games** app. Nevertheless, this is still much lower than the App Store and can demonstrate that the Google Play has a much balanced variety of apps and is not dominated by a single genre of apps. Next, we will be investigating which genre of apps have the most users."

    "### Justifying App Store app profile recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The average user rating in genre such as Reference, Social Networking, Book and Music are heavily skewed due to the presence of a few well known \"giant\" apps such as 'Bible', 'Dictionary.com', 'Facebook', 'Pinterest', 'Kinder', 'Pandora' and 'Spotify'. Other apps in these genres often have far lesser (<10000) ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Social Networking and Music genre, although it has quite a few number of apps above 10 000 ratings, the market is too saturated and there are a lot of apps to compete with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Genres such as Navigation and Weather will require  data from external parties and it will be rather costly to gather these data. Futhermore, apps like Google Map and Waze are so developed such that it will be extremely difficult to compete with them and most users will stick to using these apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Finance apps often require domain knowledge as well as expensive equipments such as servers, hence it may be costly to invent a free Finance app that profit mainly from ads.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Food & Drinks apps are dominated by chain restaurants and delivery services and our company has neither of that. However, if we are to focus on one of the apps,'Allrecipes Dinner Spinner', we can see that it has rather high user ratings of 109349. Furthermore, this is a niche market as there are not a lot of apps that provide recipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, I would suggest that the app profile be focused on Food & Drinks genre, not on the delivery or reservation domain, but rather on the preparation of food and drinks. Ads can be played in order to unlock a recipe or the next step in the recipe, bringing in revenue for the company."

Since we only want to find out which genre of apps has the most user, we do not need very precise data about it. Therefore, we will treat 10,000+ as 10,000 and 5,000,000+ as 5,000,000. \n",

Hence, the game market is not as saturated in the Google Play store. Furthermore, I have printed the top 100 apps under the **Game** category, and it can be seen that a wide variety of game apps have large number of installs. This may be due to Google Play having access to a wider market and I believe that making a free game app in the Google Play may be the best method to gain large amount of installs and hence, large amount of revenue from the ads in the games."

    "In conclusion, we have analyzed both the data set from the App Store as well as Google Play. However, the app profile we recommended is not the same. Thus, we would like to propose an app that has game features in it (such as solving a puzzle) so that it would appeal to the Google Play market. At the same time, if the reception is good, we can push it out to App Store but this time our target groups will be those **Food & Drink** app users. We may create apps that allow users to incorporate the game elements into unlocking recipes, thereby appealing to both app profiles that we have recommended."
